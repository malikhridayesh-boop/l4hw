        <p>
            Health has a variety of definitions, which have been used for different purposes over time. In general, it refers to
            physical and emotional well-being, especially that associated with normal functioning of the human body, absent of
            disease, pain (including mental pain), or injury.
            
            Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular physical exercise and adequate sleep,[1] and
            by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities or situations, such as smoking or excessive stress. Some factors
            affecting health are due to individual choices, such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while others are due
            to structural causes, such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it easier or harder for people to get
            necessary healthcare services. Still, other factors are beyond both individual and group choices, such as genetic
            disorders.
